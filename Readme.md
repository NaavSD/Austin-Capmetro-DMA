## Capital Metro Disruption Management Analysis

### Project Context
Public transit systems are essential to the modern city. The robustness of a given public transit network is key to its success. A robust public transit network manages both passenger flow and vehicle patterns successfully at high orders of efficiency. Austin recently joined the top ten cities by population in 2022 with over 1 million people currently living here. With a 27.54% increase in population in the last decade, Austin is one of the fastest growing major cities in the United States. A growing city needs to have these management systems not only to adjust for changes in population, but also to indicate when and how to adjust. A growing population changes much about the metropolitan ecosystem in which public transit operates. Navigating and responding to these changes is necessary to maintain a smooth and effective public transit network.

Part of this management system monitors bus punctuality. When multiple buses are on the same route, a bus that is too early, or too late, can compound into a problem called bus bunching or clumping. This occurs when two or more transit vehicles running the same route are arriving at the same stops in tandem. Not only can this result in one bus running the route empty for quite a while, but also causes passengers to have to wait between buses for a longer period. 

CapMetro Austin requires analysis tools for vehicle location monitoring systems that can be regularly updated to determine incidents of bus bunching and potential causes. Preventing bus bunching keeps customers from waiting long periods at stops between bus arrivals and keeps buses at operating capacities.
